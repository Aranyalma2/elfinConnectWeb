## About

Hyfling IoT and PLC manufacturing company has remote access to their devices. BUT the bridge server is very skecy and has some critical design flaws. The most annoying is that the servers are located only in China and have NO ENCRYPTION.

This project creates a very similar solution, but it can be used with the factory firmware. The IoT device's socket connect to your secure self hosted server. Basicly this is a TCP gateway from your local PC to the end device.

## What this service capable of?

This solution is completely independent of the vendor's systems and applications when in use, but currently requires the IoTService application, freely available from the vendor, to configure the devices for the first time.
